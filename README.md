# Clinic
## Project Description
Description: This Clinical System project is a C#-based application that includes four views for administrators, doctors, nurses, and receptionists. The system utilizes OCR and NLP technologies to streamline clinical operations. Administrators have the ability to manage user roles and permissions, as well as add doctors, nurses, and receptionists to the system. Doctors can access patient records, communicate with other doctors, and view upcoming appointments. Nurses can update patient information, collaborate with doctors, and perform nursing tasks. Receptionists are responsible for handling appointments, check-ins, and managing the front desk operations. OCR technology extracts relevant data from documents, while NLP technology analyzes unstructured text. The system also contains advanced AI features that help with disease prediction, prescription recommendations, and provide warnings for potential drug-to-disease interactions. It also incorporates a decision support system. These features facilitate efficient workflow, save time and space, and reduce medication errors and data loss. The primary goal of the system is to improve efficiency and enhance patient care by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for clinical management.
